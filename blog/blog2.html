                                    One of the few essentials to remember while adopting plants is to check how much water they require, and how often. Some plants don’t need watering at all during monsoons because of the high level of humidity in the air, but the opposite may apply during summers.

                                        One of the few essentials to remember while adopting plants is to check how much water they require, and how often.
